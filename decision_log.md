## 📑 Historical Logs

### 2024-05-20 - Screen 01: Authentication Launchpad
- **Context/Goal:** Centrally aligned branding with Google Sign-In and "Try as Guest" mode. Pure Dark Mode (#121212) with Primary Yellow (#FFD54F) text.
- **Conflicts & Alternatives Considered:**
  - *Conflict 1: Navigation vs Splash:* Should this be a splash screen that auto-transitions or a static launchpad? *Decision:* Launchpad as it contains interactive login elements.
  - *Conflict 2: Guest Mode State:* Should Guest Mode be a simple bypass or a separate state? *Decision:* Separate state that behaves as Premium but clears all data on session end, using a warning dialog to prevent data loss expectations.
  - *Conflict 3: Design Alignment:* Balancing centrally aligned branding with bottom-anchored legal disclaimers. *Decision:* Used a `Column` with `Arrangement.Center` for branding and a `Box` with `Alignment.BottomCenter` for legal text.
- **Final Decision:** Implement `AuthLaunchpadScreen` utilizing `UpperDotTheme`. Google Sign-In follows branding guidelines; "Try as Guest" is styled with `PrimaryYellow`.
- **Impact:** `AuthLaunchpadScreen.kt`, `AuthViewModel.kt`, `MainActivity.kt` nav graph update.
